        Here you can find details of the music releases I have made, live mixes I've recorded and easy access to select online streaming radio stations.<br/>
        There is an web based music player so you don't need to download the track/mixes/steam to enjoy it, I've also included full track lists and download links.<br/>
        For some extra fun I have also included some music visualisations so you have something to watch to while you're listening to the music.

        Some examples of the more interesting projects that I've got planned, are in development or functionally complete.<br/>
        As no project is ever really <i>complete</i> I am always happy to discuss improvements/additions, so, feel free to open an issues at Github.<br/>
        The project page will link to the frontend where the project has a web interface or direct to the repo where there isn't one.

        My Blog, or at least the closest to one that I'm ever likely to write. It will include articles on a broad range of topics from<br/>
        physical technical work, to software engineering, to musings about the past and the future of the industry and everything inbetween.<br/>
        There are a few articles up at he moment and the list will grow over time as I get a chance to work through the articles that I've got planned.<br/>
        If you'd like a preview of what's coming up, you can likely find some of the draft articles in the Github repo for this site.

        How many times do you find yourself hitting a website to use a subnet calculator? or to do an external resolving check? or a myriad of other tasks.<br/>
        This will be a place for tools of that nature, there are a couple of tools up right now and the list will be growing as I get a chance to test<br/>
        and implement the ideas I've mocked up. For now you'll have to continue using sites like mxtoolbox.com, digwebinterface.com but keep checking back.
  - name: Curriculum Vitae
    icon: student
    description:
        While you may find copies of my CV in various forms at other places on the internet, the version on my site will <b>always</b> be the most current and complete version.<br/>
        I try to keep it as concise as possible so sadly I am not able to include everything. If you have any questions don't hesitate to email me for clarification.<br/>
        It includes the typical two page personal profile as well as a quick reference listing programming and operational technology experience and should be printer friendly in chrome.<br/>
        If you like the format and/or layout, then you're free to rip the code from the github repo for this site. Attribution would be lovely but I won't loose sleep if you don't.

<p align="center">
I've put to this site together to centralise and polish some of the other spaces that I had in various places across the internet that were becoming a bit of a maintenance burden.<br/>
The menu above should provide easy access around the site (descriptions below) and everything's statically generated so bookmarking, linking, etc. should work reliably.<br/>
I've also included some light entertainment at the bottom of this page, be aware it is NOT SAFE FOR WORK and IS likely to offend if you're of a nervous disposition.
