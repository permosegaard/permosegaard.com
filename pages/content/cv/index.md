experience:
  - company: Wirehive Ltd.
    position: Lead Engineer
    period: October 2013 - November 2015
    description:
        Previously a SMB Technical Consultation company, Wirehive were trying to pivot into the
        Managed Hosting and Services industry. I was brought in to fill out technical experience that
        was lacking in the company (Windows, Databases, Networking, Automation, etc.) and to help apply
        the experience that I had gained seeing a Dedipower grow from 10 employees to ~200 through Pulsant.
        My time was roughly split in thirds with one third spent working on company growth, one spent on
        assisting and training colleagues and one spent working on 'VIP' customers.<br/>
        My time spent on company growth was distributed between technical and consultation. Technical mainly
        consisted taking the systems that were in place and working them to scale for the next 5+ years of
        projected growth. This included exposing these systems via programmable APIs and using them for automating
        the provisioning and support workload for both the new and current customers.<br/>
        While I was there my skill-set was also made available for contracted external consult, specifically
        for networking, programming and database work which were typically based on Cisco, PHP/C# and MySQL/MSSQL but
        also branched out to other disciplines and technologies when required.
        My time assisting the Technical Support Team included building out their experience in a variety of technologies,
        assisting colleagues and providing guidance on growing the team.

      - Automated the Provisioning Process and provided tooling for a variety of other processes.
      - Upgraded various systems for the next 5+ years of projected growth.
      - Supported the largest accounts and worked to build out the Technical Team.
      - Worked with all sides of the business including Sales, Marketing and Account Management.

        My daily duties morphed from a shop-floor support role to a more consultative and advisory role and eventually the most senior
        engineer in the conglomerate where I helped with the general technical running of the now largest privately help Data Center
